Description: A package providing wrapper functions for calculating geometric mean titers using 
  different approaches for non-detectable titers, in particular a non-biased maximum likelihood 
  approach based on estimating parameters of a truncated normal distribution. Also included but 
  not recommended are excludion of non-detectable titers and replacement of non-detectable titers 
  with the maximum possible value.
